Python cute based (and this repo forked from) [vim-cute-python](https://github.com/ehamberg/vim-cute-python) <br>
Cpp cude based on [vim-cute-cpp](https://github.com/LawrencePeng/vim-cute-cpp)

*This does not – at any point – alter your source code*. It simply uses Vim's
"conceal" feature to “hide” `in` behind `∈`, etc. Whenever the cursor is at
a line with concealed text, the text will be expanded.

To install, simply put `python.vim` in `~/.vim/after/syntax` or use a plug-in
manager such as [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) or
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

Vim ≥ 7.3 is required.
